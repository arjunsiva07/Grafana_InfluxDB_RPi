//Setup grafana dashboard using InfluxDB database.
Follow the commands from the grafana.txt file into a server. I used Raspberry Pi 3B. 
To view the grafana webpage, open browser and navigate to localhost:8086. This is the port used by grafana dashboard.
You can use live data or old data, copy the CSV file to the Raspberry pi local database and like it through the grafana_plotting.py file. 
Also, set the columns and tags through the .py file as well as in the dashboard. 
You CSV API is you want live data.
